To set up an Eclipse project for Assignment 3
================================================================
- Run Eclipse.
  - Select (or create) a workspace folder.
    - (Close the "Welcome" window if it is open)
  - New -> Project ... Java ... Java Project
  - Next
  - Project name: asst3
    - Create new project in workspace
    - JRE: should be at least 1.6
    - Project layout: create separate ...
    - Finish
  - Unzip the starter file, creating the folder asst3Starter
  - Drag all folders from asst3Starter/src onto the 'src' icon in the package
    explorer.
    - if asked choose the "Copy files and folders" option, here and in the
      next few steps
  - Drag the asst3Starter/lib folder onto the 'asst3' icon in the package
    explorer
  - Drag the test files, (e.g., TestSimp.java) onto the 'asst3' icon in
    the package explorer.
  - Drag the asst3Starter/jars folder onto the 'asst3' icon in the package
    explorer
  - Set up the lib file by:
    - click on the 'asst3' icon in the package explorer.
    - Project -> Properties
    - Java Build Path
    - Libraries tab
    - Add Class Folder ...
    - click on the check-box that corresponds to lib under the asst3 project
    - OK
    - OK
  - Set up the WrangLR JAR file by:
    - click on the 'asst3' icon in the package explorer.
    - Project -> Properties
    - Java Build Path
    - Libraries tab
    - Add JARs ...
    - open up 'asst3', then 'jars' in the pop-up window
    - click on wrangLRv0_8_1.jar (or whatever the JAR file name is) in the
      pop-up window
    - OK
    - OK

To run the compiler, run main/Main class as a Java Application. The first
time you run it, it will tell you "No input file name given". You can give
it a file name with:
  - Run->RunConfigurations...
  - click on JavaApplication->Main in the left panel
  - Arguments tab
  - type your filename (e.g., TestSimp.java) into the "Program Arguments"
    text area.
    - if you want to see the AST appear in a window, you should include the
      '-w' switch in addition to the filename (e.g., "-w TestSimp.java").

You now should be ready to edit your Sem1Visitor.java, Sem2Visitor.java, and
Sem3Visitor.java files in the visitor package.
